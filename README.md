# Feature Engineering for Ames Housing Dataset


This project focuses on enhancing the predictive accuracy of housing prices using the Ames Housing Dataset by applying feature engineering techniques. In real-world datasets, raw variables often lack the depth required to build robust models. Therefore, the goal of this assignment is to create three new features that capture additional relationships and nuances within the data, thereby improving the model's ability to predict house prices more accurately.

Feature engineering is a critical step in the machine learning process, as it allows us to uncover patterns and relationships that are not readily apparent from the original data. For this project, we avoided basic transformations like logarithmic transformations or missing value imputations and instead designed novel features that provide deeper insights into property characteristics.

Each feature was developed with careful consideration of its potential impact on the target variable, SalePrice. By understanding how these engineered features correlate with housing prices, we aimed to improve the model's overall performance and provide real-world value through a more detailed analysis of the Ames Housing data.

This repository contains:
- Explanations of each newly engineered feature, including their expected impact on housing prices.
- Practical reasoning behind the inclusion of each feature based on real estate market behaviors.
- Python code for generating the new features.
- A correlation matrix to demonstrate the relationships between these features and the target variable.
- Analysis of whether each feature performed as expected and insights drawn from the results.

This project showcases the importance of well-crafted features and their role in building a more accurate and reliable machine learning model. By leveraging domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis, the engineered features add value beyond what the raw dataset can offer.
